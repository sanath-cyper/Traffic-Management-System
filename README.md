# AI-Based Traffic Signal Management System ðŸš¦ðŸš—

This project is an intelligent traffic control system that uses **Computer Vision** and **route optimization APIs** to manage vehicle congestion. It adjusts signal timing based on live traffic density and suggests alternate routes.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

- **YOLOv8** â€“ Real-time vehicle detection from video feeds.
- **OpenCV** â€“ Used for frame handling, annotations, and drawing overlays.
- **Python** â€“ Core automation logic, API integration, and control flow.
- **OpenRouteService API** â€“ Suggests alternate driving routes based on congestion.
- **Random Sampling & FAKE routes** â€“ For demonstration and testing.

## ðŸ’¡ Features

- Detects traffic congestion using video footage.
- Increases green light duration dynamically based on vehicle count.
- Suggests alternate routes when congestion exceeds a threshold.
- Displays visual feedback directly on video frames.
- Includes demo locations from cities across the world.
